   abstract = {We applied several regression and deep learning methods to predict fluid intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI scans as part of the ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge 2019. We used voxel intensities and probabilistic tissue-type labels derived from these as features to train the models. The best predictive performance (lowest mean-squared error) came from kernel ridge regression (&#x0024;&#x0024;\lambda =10&#x0024;&#x0024;), which produced a mean-squared error of 69.7204 on the validation set and 92.1298 on the test set. This placed our group in the fifth position on the validation leader board and first place on the final (test) leader board.},

   abstract = {Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) are powerful multivariate methods for capturing associations across two modalities of data (e.g., brain and behaviour). However, when the sample size is similar or smaller than the number of variables in the data, CCA and PLS models may overfit, i.e., find spurious associations that generalise poorly to new data. Dimensionality reduction and regularized extensions of CCA and PLS have been proposed to address this problem, yet most studies using these approaches have some limitations. This work gives a theoretical and practical introduction into the most common CCA/PLS models and their regularized variants. We examine the limitations of standard CCA and PLS when the sample size is similar or smaller than the number of variables. We discuss how dimensionality reduction and regularization techniques address this problem and explain their main advantages and disadvantages. We highlight crucial aspects of the CCA/PLS analysis framework, including optimising the hyperparameters of the model and testing the identified associations for statistical significance. We apply the described CCA/PLS models to simulated data and real data from the Human Connectome Project and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (both of n>500). We use both low and high dimensionality versions Journal Pre-proof of each data (i.e., ratios between sample size and variables in the range of ~1-10 and ~0.1-0.01) to demonstrate the impact of data dimensionality on the models. Finally, we summarize the key lessons of the tutorial.},

   abstract = {Background: In 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Domain Criteria, an attempt to move beyond diagnostic categories and ground psychiatry within neurobiological constructs that combine different levels of measures (e.g., brain imaging and behavior). Statistical methods that can integrate such multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting, poor generalization, and difficulties in interpreting the results. Methods: We propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach, we investigated structural brain–behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires and IQ and demographic measures. Results: Both sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of brain–behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified brain–behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain volume. Conclusions: Multivariate techniques (such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis) embedded in our novel framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or symptoms to neurobiology and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition of psychiatric disorders.},

   abstract = {The brain adapts dynamically to the changing sensory statistics of its environment. Recent research has started to delineate the neural circuitries and representations that support this cross-sensory plasticity. Combining psychophysics and model-based representational fMRI and EEG we characterized how the adult human brain adapts to misaligned audiovisual signals. We show that audiovisual adaptation is associated with changes in regional BOLD-responses and fine-scale activity patterns in a widespread network from Heschl’s gyrus to dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Audiovisual recalibration relies on distinct spatial and decisional codes that are expressed with opposite gradients and time courses across the auditory processing hierarchy. Early activity patterns in auditory cortices encode sounds in a continuous space that flexibly adapts to misaligned visual inputs. Later activity patterns in frontoparietal cortices code decisional uncertainty consistent with these spatial transformations. Our findings suggest that regions within the auditory processing hierarchy multiplex spatial and decisional codes to adapt flexibly to the changing sensory statistics in the environment.},

   abstract = {The connection patterns of neural circuits form a complex network. How signaling in these circuits manifests as complex cognition and adaptive behaviour remains the central question in neuroscience. Concomitant advances in connectomics and artificial intelligence open fundamentally new opportunities to understand how connection patterns shape computational capacity in biological brain networks. Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm that uses high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems to perform computations and approximate cognitive functions. Here we present conn2res: an open-source Python toolbox for implementing biological neural networks as artificial neural networks. conn2res is modular, allowing arbitrary network architecture and dynamics to be imposed. The toolbox allows researchers to input connectomes reconstructed using multiple techniques, from tract tracing to noninvasive diffusion imaging, and to impose multiple dynamical systems, from spiking neurons to memristive dynamics. The versatility of the conn2res toolbox allows us to ask new questions at the confluence of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. By reconceptualizing function as computation, conn2res sets the stage for a more mechanistic understanding of structure-function relationships in brain networks.},

   abstract = {Many genes are linked to psychiatric disorders, but genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differential gene expression (DGE) analyses in post-mortem brain tissue often implicate distinct gene sets. This disconnect impedes therapeutic development, which relies on integrating genetic and genomic insights. We address this issue using a novel multivariate technique that reduces DGE bias by leveraging gene co-expression networks and controlling for confounds such as drug exposure. Deep RNA sequencing was performed in bulk post-mortem sgACC from individuals with bipolar disorder (BD; N=35), major depression (MDD; N=51), schizophrenia (SCZ; N=44), and controls (N=55). Toxicology data dimensionality was reduced using multiple correspondence analysis; case-control gene expression was then analyzed using 1) traditional DGE and 2) group regularized canonical correlation analysis (GRCCA) - a multivariate regression method that accounts for feature interdependence. Gene set enrichment analyses compared results with established neuropsychiatric risk genes, gene ontology pathways, and cell type enrichments. GRCCA revealed a significant association with SCZ (Pperm=0.001; no significant BD or MDD association), and the resulting gene weight vector correlated with DGE SCZ-control t-statistics (R=0.53; P{\textless}0.05). Both methods indicated down-regulation of immune and microglial genes and upregulation of ion transport and excitatory neuron genes. However, GRCCA - at both the gene and transcript level - showed stronger enrichments (FDR{\textless}0.05). Notably, GRCCA results were enriched for SCZ GWAS-implicated genes (FDR{\textless}0.05), while DGE results were not. These findings identify a SCZ-specific sgACC gene expression pattern that highlights SCZ risk genes and implicates neuro-immune pathways, thus demonstrating the utility of multivariate approaches to integrate genetic and genomic signals.},
