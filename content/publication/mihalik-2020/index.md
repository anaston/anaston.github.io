abstract: 'Background: In 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the
  Research Domain Criteria, an attempt to move beyond diagnostic categories and ground
  psychiatry within neurobiological constructs that combine different levels of measures
  (e.g., brain imaging and behavior). Statistical methods that can integrate such
  multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting, poor generalization,
  and difficulties in interpreting the results. Methods: We propose an innovative
  machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and a stability criterion
  with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse partial least squares and
  kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying hidden dimensions of cross-modality
  relationships. To illustrate the approach, we investigated structural brain–behavior
  associations in an extensively phenotyped developmental sample of 345 participants
  (312 healthy and 33 with clinical depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain
  voxel-based gray matter volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report
  questionnaires and IQ and demographic measures. Results: Both sparse partial least
  squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions
  of brain–behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one
  related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that these
  results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified brain–behavior
  associations are in agreement with previous findings in the literature concerning
  age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain volume. Conclusions: Multivariate
  techniques (such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation
  analysis) embedded in our novel framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or
  symptoms to neurobiology and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically
  grounded definition of psychiatric disorders.'
