abstract: 'The connection patterns of neural circuits form a complex network. How
  signaling in these circuits manifests as complex cognition and adaptive behaviour
  remains the central question in neuroscience. Concomitant advances in connectomics
  and artificial intelligence open fundamentally new opportunities to understand how
  connection patterns shape computational capacity in biological brain networks. Reservoir
  computing is a versatile paradigm that uses high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical
  systems to perform computations and approximate cognitive functions. Here we present
  conn2res: an open-source Python toolbox for implementing biological neural networks
  as artificial neural networks. conn2res is modular, allowing arbitrary network architecture
  and dynamics to be imposed. The toolbox allows researchers to input connectomes
  reconstructed using multiple techniques, from tract tracing to noninvasive diffusion
  imaging, and to impose multiple dynamical systems, from spiking neurons to memristive
  dynamics. The versatility of the conn2res toolbox allows us to ask new questions
  at the confluence of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. By reconceptualizing
  function as computation, conn2res sets the stage for a more mechanistic understanding
  of structure-function relationships in brain networks.'
