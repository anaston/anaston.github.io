abstract: We applied several regression and deep learning methods to predict fluid
  intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI scans as part of the ABCD Neurocognitive
  Prediction Challenge 2019. We used voxel intensities and probabilistic tissue-type
  labels derived from these as features to train the models. The best predictive performance
  (lowest mean-squared error) came from kernel ridge regression (lambda=10), 
  which produced a mean-squared error of 69.7204 on the validation
  set and 92.1298 on the test set. This placed our group in the fifth position on
  the validation leader board and first place on the final (test) leader board.
