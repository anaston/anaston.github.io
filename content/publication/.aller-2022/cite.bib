 abstract = {The brain adapts dynamically to the changing sensory statistics of its environment. Recent research has started to delineate the neural circuitries and representations that support this cross-sensory plasticity. Combining psychophysics and model-based representational fMRI and EEG we characterized how the adult human brain adapts to misaligned audiovisual signals. We show that audiovisual adaptation is associated with changes in regional BOLD-responses and fine-scale activity patterns in a widespread network from Heschl’s gyrus to dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Audiovisual recalibration relies on distinct spatial and decisional codes that are expressed with opposite gradients and time courses across the auditory processing hierarchy. Early activity patterns in auditory cortices encode sounds in a continuous space that flexibly adapts to misaligned visual inputs. Later activity patterns in frontoparietal cortices code decisional uncertainty consistent with these spatial transformations. Our findings suggest that regions within the auditory processing hierarchy multiplex spatial and decisional codes to adapt flexibly to the changing sensory statistics in the environment.},
