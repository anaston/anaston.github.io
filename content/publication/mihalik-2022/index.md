abstract: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) are
  powerful multivariate methods for capturing associations across two modalities of
  data (e.g., brain and behaviour). However, when the sample size is similar or smaller
  than the number of variables in the data, CCA and PLS models may overfit, i.e.,
  find spurious associations that generalise poorly to new data. Dimensionality reduction
  and regularized extensions of CCA and PLS have been proposed to address this problem,
  yet most studies using these approaches have some limitations. This work gives a
  theoretical and practical introduction into the most common CCA/PLS models and their
  regularized variants. We examine the limitations of standard CCA and PLS when the
  sample size is similar or smaller than the number of variables. We discuss how dimensionality
  reduction and regularization techniques address this problem and explain their main
  advantages and disadvantages. We highlight crucial aspects of the CCA/PLS analysis
  framework, including optimising the hyperparameters of the model and testing the
  identified associations for statistical significance. We apply the described CCA/PLS
  models to simulated data and real data from the Human Connectome Project and the
  Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (both of n>500). We use both low and
  high dimensionality versions of each data (i.e., ratios between
  sample size and variables in the range of ~1-10 and ~0.1-0.01) to demonstrate the
  impact of data dimensionality on the models. Finally, we summarize the key lessons
  of the tutorial.
